# JavaScript Events

This assignment was a great introduction to getting used to and playing around with DOM elements and learning how event listeners work.

## Resources

* [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) was used to help style out some of the HTML structure elements with the "visuallyhidden" class to keep the design clean.

* [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) was used to review the basics of tagging.

* [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) was used to review different HTML5 tags, get color names and hex values to use for the homework, and to get a better understanding of changing CSS with the DOM.

* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) was used to help me solve the problem of not originally being able to get the form values to print on the console.

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) was used to help me figure out and understand event listeners.

* [CSS3 Generator](http://css3generator.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#) were used for styling purposes.  

* Other than what is listed above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

This homework assignment was extremely fun! It was nice being able to get practice in with event listeners and more javascript. It helped refresh what we've already learned while making the idea of working with the DOM and event listeners less scary.
